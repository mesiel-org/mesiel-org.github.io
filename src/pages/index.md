**Mesiel** is a community-driven project dedicated to creating free and open-source programs, libraries, and tools that are *fast*, *reliable*, and *accessible*. Our goal is to provide solutions that empower people without getting in the way, offering lightweight yet powerful utilities for developers, researchers, and everyday users.

## Our Mission

- **Openness:** All Mesiel programs, libraries, and tools are free to use, modify, and share.  
- **Simplicity:** Every project is designed with clarity and maintainability in mind.  
- **Sustainability:** Code that lasts, resisting obsolescence and unnecessary complexity.

## Who We Are

Mesiel is not a company â€” it is a collective of contributors from around the world. Developers, writers, designers, and enthusiasts collaborate to create programs and libraries that benefit everyone. Whether you contribute code, report issues, or provide feedback, you are part of the project.

## Get Involved

Contributions are welcome! You can help by fixing bugs, improving documentation, suggesting features, or sharing feedback. Visit our [GitHub](https://github.com/mesiel-org) to join the community and contribute to programs, libraries, and tools that reach a wide audience.

## Status

Mesiel is actively developed, with core programs, libraries, and tools planned and maintained. The project aims to provide a reliable foundation for users who need fast, trustworthy, and cross-platform solutions.
