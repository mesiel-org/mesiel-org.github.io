MESIEL GENERAL LICENSE
Version 1.0, 2025

    Copyright (C) 2025 Mesiel Project Authors
    This license originates from the Mesiel Project, but it is intended for general
    use and may be applied to any software project. The goal is to ensure freedom,
    clarity, and maintainability while protecting users’ rights to copy, modify,
    and redistribute software. Anyone adopting this license is encouraged to follow
    its terms strictly to preserve the principles of free software.

Preamble

    The Mesiel General License (MGL) is designed to guarantee that software remains
    free in terms of freedom rather than price. “Free software” refers to the user's
    liberty to run, copy, modify, and distribute the software, and not necessarily
    to zero cost. This license emphasizes clarity, access to source code, and
    protections for contributors, ensuring that no one can impose additional
    restrictions that would inhibit these freedoms.

    By using this license, authors ensure that all recipients of their software can
    study, understand, and modify the software for personal, educational, or
    commercial purposes. The license is structured to make explicit the obligations
    and rights of everyone involved, providing a clear legal framework that is
    broadly applicable, while retaining simplicity.

    Free software works best when modifications and improvements can be shared
    among users. The MGL requires that any derivative works remain free and that
    recipients are granted the same freedoms. This approach promotes collaboration,
    sustainability, and long-term maintainability. It prevents fragmentation where
    different versions of software carry incompatible restrictions.

    This license also ensures that contributors are credited appropriately and that
    users are aware of their responsibilities. It balances freedom with the need
    for attribution, clarity, and a shared understanding of rights and obligations.
    The MGL is suitable for both small utilities and large-scale software projects.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions

    "Program" means any work licensed under this License, including source code,
    object code, executables, documentation, scripts, or other related materials.

    "You" refers to any individual or entity exercising rights granted under this
    License.

    "Derivative Work" refers to any work that modifies, adapts, translates, or
    builds upon the original Program in any way, resulting in a work based on the
    Program.

1. Source Code

    The preferred form for making modifications is the source code. Distribution of
    binaries or object code must be accompanied by access to the corresponding
    source code or instructions for obtaining it. This ensures that anyone receiving
    the Program can inspect, modify, and rebuild it, maintaining the freedom
    promised by this license.

    Access to source code is critical for debugging, security auditing, and long-term
    maintenance. Authors are encouraged to provide clear instructions on building
    and running the Program from its source.

2. Copying and Distribution

    You may copy and distribute the Program, in source or binary form, provided that
    you meet the following conditions:

        - Preserve all copyright notices and disclaimers of warranty.
        - Include the full text of this License.
        - Ensure that recipients are aware of their rights under this License.

    Distribution may occur through physical media, public repositories, websites,
    or other channels. All recipients must be informed of the MGL terms to ensure
    consistent application of the license.

    Verbatim copying ensures that the original work can be used and shared without
    modification. Redistribution of unmodified programs helps build a strong,
    trusted community and maintains a clear chain of authorship and responsibility.

3. Modifications

    You may modify the Program and create derivative works under the following
    requirements:

        - Clearly indicate the changes made and the date of modification.
        - Maintain this License for the modified work.
        - Provide access to the modified source code if distributing binaries.

    Any derivative work must not introduce restrictions beyond those of the MGL.
    The intent is to maintain the freedom of all users while allowing innovation
    and adaptation.

    Example: If you add a new feature or fix a bug, document the change in a header
    comment or a changelog, including your name and the date, so that future users
    understand the history of modifications.

4. Binary Distribution

    Distribution of compiled or executable forms is allowed under Sections 2 and 3,
    provided that:

        - The complete corresponding source code accompanies the binary, or
        - A clear method for obtaining the source is provided, free of charge or at
          a reasonable cost.

    This provision ensures transparency and maintains the ability of users to rebuild
    the Program. It is especially important for software that is distributed in
    commercial or institutional settings, where source access might otherwise be
    restricted.

5. License Integrity

    No additional restrictions may be imposed beyond those contained in this License.
    Sub-licensing or imposing proprietary terms that conflict with this License is
    prohibited. All copies, whether original or modified, must retain these freedoms
    to guarantee consistent application of the MGL.

6. Attribution

    Proper credit must be given to the original authors and contributors. Attribution
    should be included in:

        - Source files
        - Documentation
        - Distribution media
        - Websites or public announcements

    Attribution preserves the historical record of contributions and promotes recognition
    for efforts made in developing and maintaining the software.

7. Acceptance

    Using, copying, modifying, or distributing the Program constitutes acceptance
    of the MGL. If you do not accept these terms, you must not use, copy, or
    distribute the Program.

    Acceptance may be explicit, such as signing a contributor agreement, or implicit,
    through use or distribution of the software.

8. Warranty

    THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
    This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR
    A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. The entire risk of using the Program
    lies with the user. Authors and copyright holders are not liable for any damages
    arising from the use of the Program.

9. Future Versions

    The Mesiel Project may publish revised versions of this License. Users may adopt
    the version they received or any later version. Each version may provide refinements,
    clarifications, or guidance, but will remain compatible with the core principles
    of the MGL.

HOW TO APPLY THIS LICENSE TO YOUR WORK

1. Adding License Notices

    Include the following notice in every source file:

        <Program Name> — brief description
        Copyright (C) 2025 <Author Name>

        This program is free software; you may redistribute it and/or modify it under
        the terms of the Mesiel General License as published by the Mesiel Project;
        either version 1.0 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
        ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
        FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See <https://mesiel-org.github.io/license> for more details.

2. LICENSE File

    Include a full copy of this license as LICENSE.txt in the root of your project.
    This ensures that anyone obtaining the software can read and understand the
    license terms.

3. Documentation

    Reference the license in your documentation (README.md, manuals, or websites),
    providing context and clarity on the terms of use.

4. Source Availability

    If distributing binaries, ensure that the corresponding source code is accessible.
    This guarantees that users retain the freedom to inspect, modify, and rebuild
    the Program.

5. Modifications Log

    Maintain a changelog or header comments documenting all modifications. Include
    the author, date, and description of each change.

6. Attribution in Public Use

    Always provide clear attribution to original authors in any public display,
    including project pages, publications, and social media announcements.

7. Responsibilities of Distributors

    Distributors of the Program, whether original or modified, are responsible for
    informing recipients of their rights under this License. This includes explicit
    communication about the ability to copy, modify, and redistribute the software
    under the MGL. Failure to provide such information may result in confusion or
    inadvertent restriction of freedoms, which this License seeks to prevent.

    Distributors should provide clear instructions for accessing the source code,
    especially for binary distributions. Where possible, include build scripts,
    dependency information, and configuration details to ensure reproducibility.

8. Contributor Guidelines

    Contributors are encouraged to:

        - Submit modifications with clear documentation.
        - Maintain backward compatibility where feasible.
        - Respect existing attribution and copyright notices.
        - Avoid introducing restrictive licensing in derivative works.

    By contributing to a project under the MGL, you agree to allow your modifications
    to remain freely available under the same License. This promotes community
    collaboration, long-term sustainability, and collective improvement of the
    software ecosystem.

    Contributors should also document changes in a readable format, using header
    comments, changelogs, or version control commit messages. This ensures that
    future users understand the evolution of the software.

9. Interoperability with Other Licenses

    The MGL is designed to be compatible with other permissive licenses that do not
    impose additional restrictions. When combining code under multiple licenses,
    care must be taken to ensure that the combined work respects the terms of all
    applicable licenses.

    For example, if incorporating code under the MGL into a project with a
    permissive MIT-style license, the resulting work may be distributed under the
    terms of both licenses, provided that all obligations are met. However, merging
    with more restrictive licenses may not be allowed if it conflicts with the core
    freedoms guaranteed by the MGL.

10. Enforcement

    Compliance with the terms of this License is required for lawful use, copying,
    modification, or distribution of the Program. If you fail to meet the conditions
    outlined in this License, your rights under the MGL are automatically terminated
    without prejudice to any other legal remedies.

    Parties are encouraged to notify the original authors or maintainers of any
    non-compliance, and efforts should be made to resolve issues amicably. Legal
    action may be taken only as a last resort.

11. International Use

    The MGL is intended to be globally applicable. It acknowledges variations in
    local laws but asserts that the freedoms it guarantees are universally relevant.
    Users outside the country of origin may still rely on the core principles of
    freedom, access to source, and permissive redistribution. Adaptation to local
    legal frameworks may be required, but the underlying obligations and rights must
    remain intact.

12. Preservation of Notices

    All copies of the Program, whether modified or unmodified, must preserve all
    existing copyright, license notices, and disclaimers. This ensures that every
    recipient is aware of the legal framework governing the software and the
    responsibilities it entails.

13. Non-Discrimination

    This License imposes no restrictions on who may use, modify, or distribute the
    Program. It cannot be limited to particular fields of endeavor, commercial or
    non-commercial, or specific types of users. The freedoms granted apply equally
    to all recipients.

14. Transparency

    The MGL encourages transparency in both code and documentation. Build processes,
    algorithms, and design decisions should be understandable by users. When
    distributing binaries, provide sufficient information for the reconstruction of
    the source code and reproduction of functionality.

    Transparency ensures that the software remains auditable, secure, and maintainable
    over time. Users can verify the behavior of the Program and contribute confidently.

15. Limitations

    While the MGL provides freedoms to use, copy, and modify, it does not grant any
    warranty or guarantee of functionality. Users must understand that software may
    contain bugs, security vulnerabilities, or other limitations. The License limits
    liability of the authors to ensure that the freedoms can be exercised without
    legal risk to contributors.

16. Best Practices

    Users and contributors are encouraged to follow best practices for software
    development:

        - Comment code clearly and meaningfully.
        - Write modular and maintainable code.
        - Use version control to track changes.
        - Test thoroughly before distributing modifications.

    Following these practices improves the overall quality of the software and
    reduces the likelihood of errors, ensuring that the freedoms granted by the MGL
    are practical and beneficial.

17. Educational Use

    The MGL explicitly supports educational use. Teachers, students, and researchers
    are free to study, modify, and redistribute the Program. This promotes learning
    and understanding of software principles, algorithms, and system design.

18. Community Involvement

    The strength of free software relies on active communities. The MGL encourages
    sharing improvements, reporting bugs, and participating in discussions. Community
    engagement ensures the longevity and relevance of software, benefiting all users.

19. Historical Notes

    The Mesiel General License draws inspiration from established free software
    licenses, incorporating lessons learned from decades of open-source development.
    Its goal is simplicity, clarity, and enforceability while promoting a cooperative
    software culture.

20. How to Distribute Modified Works

    When distributing modified works:

        - Include clear notices of modification.
        - Retain original copyright and license notices.
        - Ensure recipients understand the MGL terms.
        - Provide access to source code, either included or through clear instructions.

    This ensures that derivative works remain free and maintain the spirit of the original
    software.

21. Applying the License in Practice

    Steps to apply the MGL to your project:

        1. Add the standard header to each source file.
        2. Include a LICENSE.txt file in the root of the project.
        3. Document the license in README.md and other relevant documentation.
        4. Ensure that any distribution, binary or source, complies with Sections 2–4.
        5. Provide guidance for contributors about attribution, modification, and submission.

22. Summary of Core Principles

    The MGL is built upon:

        - Freedom to use software for any purpose.
        - Freedom to study and modify the source code.
        - Freedom to redistribute copies, modified or unmodified.
        - Preservation of attribution and notices.
        - Responsibility to pass on freedoms.
        - Prohibition of additional restrictions.
        - Encouragement of transparency, collaboration, and community engagement.
        - Legal clarity and simplicity to reduce barriers for contributors and users.

23. Additional Guidance

    While not legally mandatory, following these guidelines helps maintain the integrity
    of the license:

        - Clearly separate original code from modifications.
        - Use descriptive changelogs or commit messages.
        - Maintain clear versioning.
        - Document build instructions and dependencies.

24. Accessibility

    The MGL encourages accessibility in all software. Efforts should be made to ensure
    that programs are usable by people with different abilities. This includes
    thoughtful design of user interfaces, clear documentation, and support for
    assistive technologies.

25. Long-Term Maintenance

    Projects licensed under the MGL benefit from the long-term maintainability
    emphasis. Contributors should design systems that are easy to understand,
    extend, and adapt over time. This reduces fragmentation and ensures the software
    remains useful for years.

26. Legal Clarity

    The MGL strives to reduce ambiguity in legal language while maintaining enforceability.
    This clarity ensures that both authors and users understand their rights and
    obligations without requiring extensive legal interpretation.
